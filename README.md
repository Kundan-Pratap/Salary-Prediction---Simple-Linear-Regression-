# Salary Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is 'Salary_Data.csv', which contains information about years of experience and corresponding salaries.

## Model

A linear regression model is used to predict salary based on years of experience.

## Results

The model demonstrates a strong correlation between years of experience and salary, as evidenced by the R-squared score and the visualization of the regression line.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
3. You can use the model to predict salary for a given number of years of experience.

## Future Work

* Improve the model using more advanced techniques.
* Incorporate additional features, such as education level or location.
